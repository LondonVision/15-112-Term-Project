Name: pyCraft
Description: It is a Minecraft and Terraria hybrid game taking elements from both games. It contains most of the standard Minecraft gameplay but with the two-dimensional aspect of Terraria rather than three as in Minecraft. 

In order to run this game, the user should run the Main file
As long as the user has all the files that come in the folder, the game will run

To move left and right, use "a" and "d" respectively
To jump press "Space"
To mine a block, click on that solid block with an open hand (blocks have individual "toughness" so click multiple times)
Also in order to mine and place, the block has to be reletively close to the player
To place a block, select a block in the hotbar and click on a background block
To move the selected option on the hotbar, press the number of the slot you want to select 1-9 and 0 selects slot 20
To open or close the inventory press "e"
To move an item in the inventory click the block and click on a new slot in the inventory
To split a stack of items in the inventory hover over the desired stack and press "x"
To craft an item, put a few items into the crafting grid and see if it makes an output

If a player gets within 20 blocks of the left or right edge, the world will expand 100 blocks in that direction (this may cause a bit of lag so be patient when it expands)
